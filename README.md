1. ToDO List APP

   -->We built this Application by Django Framework.
   -->We have implemented a lot of basics (CRUD) like adding a new task in the ToDo list and updating and deleting existing tasks. 
   -->We have tried to make them different by adding a Template section in which the user can convert his/her task into some template it will help the user to remember the ToDO task it will be fun for the user.
   -->We have provided a filter with respective months for our ToDo list.
   -->We have given a contact form for communicating with our Production team.
